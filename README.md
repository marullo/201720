# Get Help

There are a number of ways you can ask for help. Here are just a few, in order of preference!

1. Use the read-search-ask strategy when you get stuck:
  - First, read the error message, if one exists.
  - If that didn't help, search Google.
  - Finally, ask another human, like your classmates, professor, or a community resource.
1. An [issue](https://github.com/cop1000/201720/issues/new) is the easiest, cleanest way to reach the professor or classmates. Issues can be seen by everyone, so if another student has the same problem as you, they'll be able to add to your issue. They're also organized by threads, so if there are multiple problems, we can create an issue for each one and solve them separately. If another student knows the answer to your issue, they can comment directly and you might get some help without having to wait for the instructor.
1. If you are communicating confidential information (like questions about your grade, your VID number, phone number, etc), do not use issues. Instead, send an e-mail. You can email the professor or your classmates using the link that appears on Blackboard.
1. The [`#open-hangout`](https://cop1000valencia.slack.com/messages/open-hangout/) channel on Slack is open chat with all your classmates (I currently teach 3 COP 1000 classes with 25 students each, so that means you have access to 75 students in the Slack channel!).
1. Online communities like [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com) and [FreeCodeCamp](http://www.freecodecamp.com/) are fantastic ways to get some help. However, if their help yields to a solution, you should attribute credit to them.
1. Tutoring is available at every campus, although each campus has its own tutors with unique expertise. Not every tutor will be familiar with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or GitHub. However, programming concepts are universal and do transfer from one language to another. For example, if you're trying to learn loops in JavaScript, and the tutor you're working with knows C++, they should still be able to help you understand the concept of loops and help you with the syntax in JavaScript by looking it up. You, too, will get the incredible ability to pick up new programming languages with ease once you learn your first :smile:
1. The professor checks issues, Slack, and email once every 24 business hours. This means that if you send an email on Friday at 5pm, you probably won't get a response until Tuesday morning. Please keep this in mind and plan ahead when you're reaching out for help.
